# What is scripting?

**scripting** is a curated collection of modular and reusable Bash scripts built for Linux system automation. It includes CLI tools for system setup, package installation, backup management, Docker/Kubernetes operations, and more â€” all structured with best practices, logging, versioning, and extensibility in mind.

These scripts follow a strict template-based CLI format and are ideal for sysadmins, DevOps engineers, or Linux enthusiasts automating dotfiles, services, environments, and infrastructure components.
